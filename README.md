This is an R notebook file. 
It contains codes to test effect of various foraging parameters on the net energy gain during the foraging. 
floral constancy is the tendency of pollinators to visit flowers of the same species in cosicutive menner, even when flowers of other species are available.
The idea is to test when is it energetically optimal for pollinators to be floral constant and when is it not optimal. Therefore, I have included cost of switching, and unequal reward abundnace in an environment with three morphs/species. 
The code simulated pollinator movement and tests the effect of floral consatncy on floralging energetics, given the foraging cost of switching, nectar reward and unequal abundance of species/morphs.
